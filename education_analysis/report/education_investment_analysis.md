## Abstract
This study analyzes education investment patterns across European Union countries using data from Eurostat and the World Bank. The project implements a comprehensive data pipeline that collects, processes, and analyzes semi-structured data from multiple sources. Using PostgreSQL for structured economic data and MongoDB for semi-structured policy documents, we developed an integrated analysis system that reveals correlations between education investment and economic indicators. Our analysis uncovers significant trends in education spending, its relationship with GDP and employment rates, and the impact of education policies. The findings suggest strong positive correlations between education investment and economic growth, with notable variations across different EU regions.

## I. Introduction

### Background
Education investment is a critical factor in economic development and social progress. The European Union has consistently emphasized the importance of education funding through various initiatives and policies. However, understanding the complex relationships between education investment, economic indicators, and policy implementation requires sophisticated data analysis approaches.

### Objectives
1. To analyze education investment trends across EU countries using complex data from multiple sources
2. To investigate correlations between education spending and economic indicators
3. To evaluate the impact of education policies on investment patterns
4. To assess the efficiency of education investment across different countries

### Research Questions
1. How does education investment vary across EU countries, and what trends emerge over time?
2. What is the relationship between education investment and economic indicators such as GDP and employment rates?
3. How do education policies influence investment patterns?
4. Which countries demonstrate the most efficient use of education investment?

## II. Related Work

### Education Investment Analysis
Previous studies have examined education investment patterns in various contexts. [1] analyzed the relationship between education spending and economic growth in OECD countries, finding positive correlations but noting diminishing returns. [2] investigated the impact of education policies on investment patterns, highlighting the importance of policy consistency.

### Data Integration Approaches
Research by [3] demonstrated the effectiveness of combining structured and semi-structured data in education policy analysis. Their work showed how integrating multiple data sources can provide more comprehensive insights into policy impacts.

### Visualization Techniques
[4] established best practices for visualizing education data, emphasizing the importance of temporal analysis and comparative visualizations. Their work influenced our choice of visualization methods.

### Limitations of Previous Work
Most previous studies focused on either structured economic data or policy analysis, but few attempted to integrate both. Our work addresses this gap by combining multiple data sources and analysis methods.

## IV. Analysis Results

### Part A: Education Investment Analysis (Xin Wang)

#### 1. Education Investment Distribution

![Education Investment Distribution](../visualizations/education_investment_distribution.png)
*Figure 1: Education Investment Distribution by Country (% of GDP). This visualization shows the current education investment levels across EU countries, with Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Denmark) consistently maintaining the highest investment levels above 6% of GDP. Central European countries (Germany, France) show moderate investment levels around 5%, while Mediterranean and Eastern European countries generally invest between 4-5% of GDP.*

![Investment Growth Rates](../visualizations/investment_growth_rates.png)
*Figure 2: Annual Education Investment Growth Rates (2015-2023). The graph demonstrates varying growth rates across regions, with Eastern European countries showing the highest growth rates (Estonia: 4.1%, Latvia: 3.8%). This suggests a catching-up effect as these countries work to close the investment gap with Western European nations.*

#### 2. Regional Analysis

![Regional Investment Comparison](../visualizations/regional_investment_comparison.png)
*Figure 3: Regional Investment Comparison. The left panel shows per-capita education investment in euros, highlighting the significant lead of Nordic countries (â‚¬9,800 per capita) compared to other regions. The right panel displays the Early Education Focus Score, which measures the emphasis placed on early childhood education, where Nordic countries again demonstrate leadership with a score of 85/100.*

### Part B: Economic Impact Analysis (Shudong Wang)

#### 1. GDP Growth and Education Investment

![GDP Growth Distribution](../visualizations/gdp_growth_distribution.png)
*Figure 4: GDP Growth Distribution by Investment Level. This visualization uses violin plots to show the distribution of GDP growth rates across different investment levels. High-investment countries (>6% GDP) achieve an average growth rate of 3.2% with lower volatility, while low-investment countries show lower average growth (1.8%) and higher volatility. The narrower distribution for high-investment countries suggests more stable and predictable economic growth.*

![Education-GDP Correlation](../visualizations/education_gdp_correlation.png)
*Figure 5: Education Investment and GDP Growth Correlation. The scatter plot with trend line shows a positive correlation between education investment and GDP growth. The analysis reveals that a 1% increase in education investment correlates with approximately 0.3% increase in GDP growth, with a typical 2-3 year lag before maximum impact.*

#### 2. Employment Impact Analysis

![Employment Trends](../visualizations/employment_trends.png)
*Figure 6: Employment Trends by Education Investment Level (2015-2023). The graph shows employment rates over time for countries grouped by their education investment levels. High-investment countries consistently maintain employment rates 5-8 percentage points above low-investment countries, with the gap widening in knowledge-intensive sectors.*

![Youth Employment Impact](../visualizations/youth_employment_impact.png)
*Figure 7: Youth Employment and Education Investment Impact. This visualization demonstrates the particularly strong correlation between education investment and youth employment rates. Countries with strong vocational education systems show 12% higher youth employment rates, and the time-to-first-employment is significantly reduced in high-investment regions.*

#### 3. Innovation and Long-term Effects

![Innovation Metrics](../visualizations/innovation_metrics.png)
*Figure 8: Innovation Metrics by Investment Level. The chart compares various innovation indicators (patent applications, R&D investment, tech startups, research publications) across different investment levels. High-investment countries show consistently better performance across all metrics, with patent applications 23% higher and tech startup creation 42% higher than in low-investment countries.*

![Long-term Effects](../visualizations/long_term_effects.png)
*Figure 9: Long-term Economic Effects of Education Investment. This projection model shows the cumulative economic impact of different investment levels over time. High-investment countries are projected to achieve 45% higher economic development indices by 2030 compared to their 2010 baseline, while low-investment countries are projected to achieve only 15% growth.*

### Part C: Policy Impact Analysis

#### 1. Policy Implementation Effectiveness

![Policy Impact Metrics](../visualizations/policy_impact_metrics.png)
*Figure 10: Policy Implementation Effectiveness. This comparison between centralized and decentralized education systems shows that decentralized systems achieve 18% better resource utilization and 20% higher stakeholder satisfaction. The data suggests that local autonomy in education policy implementation leads to more efficient resource allocation and better adaptation to regional needs.*

![Investment Efficiency](../visualizations/investment_efficiency.png)
*Figure 11: Investment Efficiency Metrics. The visualization compares the efficiency of different investment areas, showing that digital infrastructure investments yield the highest ROI (Return on Investment), followed by teacher training programs. Administrative costs vary significantly by region, with decentralized systems showing 15% lower overhead costs.*
